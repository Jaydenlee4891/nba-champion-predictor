# nba-champion-predictor
Hello so the goal of this project is to train a machine learning algorithm to predict this seasons NBA champion.
The current time of me writting this is before the first game of the Conference finals have begun.
I will be using data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ of the past 10 seasons to train the machine.
I will be exculsively using data from the playoffs to train the machine.
